## systemd-minio-service
This is a systemd service to start the [MinIO S3 compatible object storage server](https://min.io/).

### INTRODUCTION

**Work in progress**

This was developed to enable easy install and packaging an rpm for use with openSUSE.

### INSTALLATION
For openSUSE only at present via rpm as there are rpm macros that run to install the sysconfig and systemd service. There is a simple Makefile included that could be modified for other distributions.
